# Porter's Go Vanity Server

Porter uses a vanity import, for example `get.porter.sh/porter` instead of `github.com/getporter/porter`, so that our go package imports aren't tied to our source control.

This repository contains a tiny website that hosts the redirect pages that make it work. A big thanks to Nate Finch for [explaining how to do this][blog]. 🙇‍♀️
